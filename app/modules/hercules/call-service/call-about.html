          About Call Service (Hybrid Service)
        </h5>

        <p>
          Call Service (Hybrid Service) enables your users to collaborate instantly
          by effortlessly sharing their desktops from Cisco Spark clients while they
          are on their phones (Aware feature) and answer their work calls or call
          colleagues from their Cisco Spark client (Connect feature).
        </p>

        <p>
          Cisco Hybrid Services empower cloud-based and premises-based
          solutions to deliver a more capable, better integrated collaboration user
          experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          To use Hybrid Services, register your Cisco Expressway with the Collaboration
          Cloud to install your Connectors.
          Then, you can monitor and manage Connectors from the Cloud
          Collaboration Management Portal or from your Cisco Expressways.
