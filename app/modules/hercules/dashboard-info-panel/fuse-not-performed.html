      <span>Register Cisco Expressway for Hybrid Services</span>
    </cs-accordion-heading>

    <p>Register each Cisco Expressway (or cluster) with Cisco Collaboration Cloud as follows. For clusters, you only
      need to register the master peer.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use a new browser window or tab to log on to the Cisco Expressway (master peer if clustered).</li>
      <li>Go to Applications > Hybrid Services > Connector Management and click Register. You should now see links to
        your Connectors from that page.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Visit the <a href="http://help.ciscospark.com" target="_blank">Hybrid Services help site</a> for more
      information.</p>
